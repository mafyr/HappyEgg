# 🥚 Happy Egg

**Built with React.js**

A fun and casual physics-based game where you guide a happy egg as it bounces on moving tiles, avoids sharp spikes, and collects coins — all while staying alive through 3 eggy lives!

## 🎮 Features

- 🎯 **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Gravity, jumping, falling, and collision mechanics.
- 🔪 **Sharp Tiles**: Appear after 4 seconds — landing on one causes a loss of life and fall.
- 💰 **Coin Collection**: Grab coins to increase your score.
- ❤️ **Lives System and game over**: If the egg falls below the screen or touches 3 sharp tiles, it's game over.
- 🧱 **Dynamic Tiles**: Regular and sharp tiles move continuously upward.
- 🖥️ **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on different screen sizes.
